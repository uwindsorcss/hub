#### Bird (very easy) courses

Your degree audit will have a section called *"Any Area of Study"* that allows you to take any course from any department (including the easy Computer Science courses that don't normally count for your major). The regular Computer Science Honour degree allows **seven** of these courses, and the Software Engineering specialization degree allows **four**. 

List of bird courses:

- **ECON-1100 Introduction to Economics I** - Harshdip found this course easy. The midterms and finals were all multiple choice.
- **ECON-1110 Introduction to Economics II**
- **COMP-2067 Programming for Beginners**
- **COMP-2057 Intro to the Internet** - Eric found this course *very* easy, just simple HTML/CSS assignments.
- **COMP-2097 Social Media and Mobile Technology for End Users** - Eric found this course easy but busy with assignments/projects.
- **COMP-2707 Advanced Website Design** - Eric found this course easy (HTML, CSS, a bit of Javascript) but a lot of work with assignments/projects.

#### Planning your courses
It is always better to have a good plan about the course you'll be taking each semester. Harshdip has completed 4 semesters, taking all the major courses. This way saving up all the electives is one approach. If you find 5 courses overwhelming, taking only 4 courses or an easy elective as a 5th course is another approach. Check out the list of bird courses.

##### Jose's recommended course sequence for the first two years of University
First two years of University most CS students take the same courses as CS doesn't have many electives. I also recommend you take mandatory courses as third and fourth year you are going to want to have electives to take fun CS courses. 
Harshdip has followed this exact sequence.

###### First Semester
- COMP-1000 Key Concepts in Computer Science
- COMP-1400 Intro to Programming & Algorithms I
- MATH-1760 Functions and Differential Calculus
- MATH-1250 Linear Algebra
- Elective (See if you can take another mandatory course you will have to do in the future)

###### Second Semester
- ECON-1100 Intro to Economics 1 or Physcology (I took econ because I find it more fun and applicable)
- COMP-1410 Intro to Programming & Algorithms II
- COMP-2650 Computer Architecture 1
- MATH-1730 Integral Calculus
- MATH-1020 Mathematical Foundations

###### Third Semester
- COMP-2310 Theoretical Foundations of Comp Sci
- COMP-2120 Obj Oriented Programming using Java
- COMP-2560 Systems Programming
- COMP-2540 Data Structures & Algorithms
- STAT-2910 Statistics for the Sciences

###### Fourth Semester
- COMP-3150 Database Management Systems
- COMP-2140 Languages, Grammars and Translators
- COMP-2660 Comp Archi II
- COMP-3220 Obj Oriented Software Anal/Des
- COMP-3710 Artificial Intelligence Concepts

# Co-op and Internships
------------

See [Eric's presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/190dl_nHBM-1qDiknOmjwA5-5SJLUUDQn1n10NsS9Bi8/edit?usp=sharing) on behalf of CSS for landing an internship. This covers a bit of everything (resumes, applying, interviews).

### Resume Examples
- [Jose Nicolas Alba Aguado](http://josealba.org/files/JoseAlba_Resume.pdf)
- [Eric Pickup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QUNbEYP0TBf33-JeCfXFwp_eoqI5YDql/view)
- [Brandon Lucier](https://blucier.com/Resume.pdf)
- [Harshdip Singh Deogan](https://hsdeogan.com/Resume-HarshdipSinghDeogan.pdf)


### Job Boards

- [intern.supply](http://intern.supply) - Eric highly recommends this. Links are usually broken but this is a master list of fantastic companies that offer internships which you can search for yourself.
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) - Eric also recommends this - it's not just a social network for bugging recruiters. LinkedIn has an integrated job board where you can find *tons* of internships.
- [Summer 2019 Internships](https://github.com/christine-hu/summer-2019-internships) - A document on Github that keeps track of summer internship opportunities.


### Interview Preparation

Eric recommends studying/practicing technical interview questions for any mid-to-large-sized company. Most of them will ask you highly technical coding questions.

##### Resources
- [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com) - Eric highly recommends LeetCode and used it for all of his interview prep. It has hundreds of questions with difficulty ratings and company-specific questions submitted by interviewees. Most internships will ask LeetCode easy/mediums.
- [Leetfree](https://leetfree.com/) - This website contains all LeetCode Premium problems for free.
- **Cracking the Coding Interview** - Eric highly recommends reading this book before getting into LeetCode for interview prep. You can find it on Amazon or probably a PDF online.
- [Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition) - Online solutions for the problems in Cracking the Coding Interview. Harshdip recommends to try all the problems on your own and only looking for solutions once you have tried everything you know.
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - Brandon highly recommends getting familiar with the  HackerRank editor and available languages. Many companies will supply a timed HackerRank coding challenge to be completed when applying to internships. It can also be used like LeetCode to solve hundreds of technical programming problems.
- [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) - Eric highly recommends looking at a company's profile on Glassdoor if you're interviewing with them. Glassdoor allows people to post reviews, salaries and most importantly interview questions they've received from specific companies.

### Working in the U.S.A.

Almost every major tech company in the USA hires Canadians and will sponsor you for a visa. US companies tend to pay *significantly* more and provides great opportunities. Eric highly suggests trying to land an internship in the Bay Area or New York.

#### Visa

You'll need to obtain a J-1 visa to intern in the United States.

A common misconception is that you can get a visa yourself - this is not true. You need a company who is willing to sponsor your visa to work in the United States. Once you find this company they will do most of the work for you, you'll just have to submit some documents/forms. Don't stress about this step.

#### Getting paid

You'll need an American bank account to get paid if you're working in the USA. This is very easy to obtain - just go to your preferred bank once you're in the USA and bring your passport and visa documents just in case. Eric suggests Bank of America if you're working in the Bay Area - it took him 1 hour to get an account.

It's also a very good idea to obtain a Social Security Number in the USA so that you can apply for a credit card and build up a credit score in the US (can be helpful in many ways in the future). This is also straight-forward and you need to wait until you're in the USA for at least 10 days before you can apply.


# Miscellaneous
------------
- [University Guide by Jose Alba](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaK6moqKLeFBVVfZ1gJAYCV_DsuvNxHvRAykeAMUhYU/edit?fbclid=IwAR2vBoM9rOHdwhU5ueukdeYdEeXe-slz2BiF5kZBZ0NF14SjbtuLDhl4jpU) - Jose Alba is a recent graduate from University of Windsor and he has written a good document where he shares his experiences and tips for making the most out of your university life.

### General Advice

#### Jose's Advice

###### Take Chances
Most University stuents are in the their early twenties. This is a great time to take chances in life. For example Eric and Jose had one long weekend in California so we decided to rent a car with a friend knowing full well we would have to drive ten hours to Death Valley, sleep in the car, and drive another ten hours back. To me, this was worth it as we had the chance to go on some amazing hikes with people we have met throughout our co-op/internship experiences.

###### Hard Times
University is going to be hard sometimes. Jose and Eric had a full course load while doing internships in California. They knew it was going to be hard, but they knew that it was going to be worth it afterwards. This is why I recommend you enjoy your free-time since you will not always have it.

### Student Exchanges 

Jose thinks Exchanges are fun and 100% worth it.
